Lens.js
-------

A gravitational lensing library in Javascript. The aim is to have the library contain a gravitational lens object and the mathematics needed to work with the lens. All the Javascript that deals with display in the browser, and interaction, will be kept separate so that this library can be reused in multiple places.
